Working remotely from Hawai'i is great. I wake up, "commute" to work in the tiny house in my macadamia nut orchard, and get to pop into the *hale* for breaks with the family. When I'm hungry I grab some bananas from our yard, or maybe starfruit or a papaya or two. Perhaps even some roasted macadamias from the aforementioned orchard. Living here is great, but it has not been a simple path to getting here. Before we go there, though, perhaps I should start at the beginning.

## Going Remote

In 2018 I had been working at Google in Boulder, Colorado for around four years. The job was great, but my wife and I weren't super happy living in Boulder. We moved around Boulder a couple times trying to find the ideal location, but between the wildfire risk in the foothills and the snowy winter, life just wasn't clicking for us. We knew we wanted to go somewhere warm. California came to mind, and so did Florida, but in the end it was surprisingly easy for us to figure out where we *really* wanted to move to.

We had been to Hawai'i twice on vacation and we both loved the energy of the people and the land, especially on the Big Island. It had the lovely side benefit of being the only state actually in the tropics. With the approximate location set, we began the challenging task of figuring out how to actually live there.

I tried mightily to convince various teams at Google that my physical location didn't actually matter. I could work on Pacific time, I argued. I'd get super-fast internet and fly in to some Google office to work on a regular basis. Alas, Google just doesn't work that way. With dozens of offices, Google readily supports transferring to different locations, but remote work is extremely rare. Once it was clear that continuing to work for Google from Hawai'i was out of the question, I set out to figure out how to work for someone else from there. As an aside, there are very very few software engineering jobs in Hawai'i. The major industry in Hawai'i is tourism and the vast majority of the few software jobs are on Oahu.

After a fairly short job search I ended up landing a remote Infrastructure role for an SF-based company. The company was super supportive of being remote (even from Hawai'i) and I was on board with their mission so I took the plunge and left Google.

## Choosing an island

Hawai'i is comprised of a few major islands, and several smaller ones. The lions share of the poulation lives on Oahu with most of the rest equally divided between Maui and the Big Island. There is a strong Oahu vs. neighbor islands divide in Hawai'i. Oahu is very urbanized and Honolulu is the only significantly large city in the state. The other islands have small cities (e.g. Hilo is around 40K people), but are largely rural. Our own preference was to have some land for growing our own food, so we were looking in more rural areas.

We were mostly set on the Big Island already, and given that we wanted to have a bit of land it was the best choice from an affordability perspective. The main advantages of the Big Island are it's relatively lower cost of living, lower density, and for me, less of a feeling of being trapped on a tiny island in the Pacific. The main drawback is that the center-of-gravity for the state is Oahu, and there are certain things (e.g. many medical producedures) that can only be done there. 

## Internet access

For a remote worker, internet access is essential. You can make do with minimal work spaces and just a laptop typically suffices for most work, but fast and reliable internet is critical. That's super easy to come by in Honolulu, but a bit harder on the Big Island. Hawai'i has a cable provider (Spectrum), and a legacy phone provider (Hawaiian Telcom). Both have the usual cable/dsl/fiber options available across the state, but the specifics about where they are present are a bit complicated. We live in the district of North Kohala. It sits on the very northern tip of the Big Island and it's mostly empty land with some farms surrounding the two small villages of Hawi and Kapa'au (each ~1000 people).

As an example, DSL access is limited to about 5 mb/s and is not universally available in and around these villages. Cable internet, on the other hand, is available in many locations with speeds up to 1 gb. The funny thing about the cable internet availability is that you can look on the poles and see where the lines physically stop on a given road. One house past that point and you are completely out of luck.

We looked at other areas on the Big Island and outside of Hilo and Kona, much the same pattern exists as in North Kohala. There are pockets of cable internet and they abruptly end at seemingly arbitrary boundaries. The most reliable way to figure out where cable is available is to look on Street View and identify the cable tv lines on the telephone poles! Spectrum will take just about any address in their online form and tell you cable is available, so it's entirely useless. Even though the Street View images are from 2011, not much has changed in terms of cable availability so they are the best bet for checking specific addresses, or neighborhoods.

Interestingly, Hawaiian Telcom is starting to offer fiber-to-the-premises in some areas. Their online tool does accurately represent what internet is available, although it's ridiculously slow to get data out of the tool. On the Big Island the fiber availability seems to be mostly limited to some very impoverished areas of the Puna district where they received federal grant funding to install it. It's great that they are providing high-speed internet to impoverished areas, but it's completely baffling why it's not available elsewhere.

Realistically, cable internet from Spectrum is really the only option throughout most of the Big Island. Beware, though, of the large swaths of Ka'u, Puna, Hamakua, and North Kohala where it's simply not available.

## The time zone

Hawai'i is two or three hours behind Pacific time since Hawai'i does not follow daylight savings time. This is a very manageable time difference when dealing with coworkers on the US west coast. It's another three time zones to the east coast, of course, which is a much more challenging for having any substantial amount of overlap with coworkers there.

My existing team is split between the west coast and the east coast, so we end up doing team meetings at 8 am my time so that everyone can attend. It works well enough, but it makes for a limited window to collaborate with those east coast colleagues before they finish their day. Interestingly, Hawai'i is also positioned to catch some overlap with east Asia and Australia. The main caveat is that afternoon in Hawai'i is morning on the **next day** in Asia, so their Monday and your Friday are lost for collaboration.

## Others' Perception

Hawai'i is mostly seen as a vacation destination, so the fact that you are working from there leads some people to believe that you're not really working very hard. This perception issue is present, but fairly easily resolved by simply getting shit done. It's hard to argue with results. Besides, you can have it both ways -- work hard when you need to AND enjoy the perks of living in a place most people only experience for a week or two at a time.

## Cost of Living

Hawai'i is expensive. Not quite [Bay Area expensive][1], but Honolulu is close. The rest of the state is cheaper, and some places (e.g. Puna on the Big Island) are quite a lot cheaper. Food and housing are both substantially more expensive than the mainland, but there are ways to bring those costs down. Eating locally-grown food helps a lot. This might require a bit of a diet shift, though. If you eat a lot of meat and dairy, you're going to pay a huge premium for that privilege.

### Costco

It's worth mentioning Costco specifically here. It feels like practically everyone on the island shops at the one Costco in Kona. There's good reason for that as prices on dry goods are very close to what you see on the mainland, unlike many other stores. Anything that needs refrigeration is more expensive than on the mainland, but significantly cheaper than elsewhere. The main reason, though, that everyone shops at Costco is the cheap gas prices. It's often [80 cents a gallon cheaper][2] at Costco than at nearby stations.

### Electricity

Hawai'i has the highest [electric rates][3] in the US. Our electric bill is over $200 per month despite using propane for cooking and hot water. That's the bad news. The good news is that solar (PV and hot water) is ridiculously viable here. We're actually in the process of going off-grid with a solar PV + battery system. So, the high prices for electricity are important to consider, but there are ways to drastically cut them, especially if you're not renting.

### Housing

You can buy a [nice house in Puna district][4] for under $300k. You can also buy a [nice house in South Kohala district][5] for several million dollars. Puna is the most affordable area, but it has drawbacks including: lava inundation risk and higher crime. Most other areas on the island are substantially more expensive. We settled on North Kohala as the best balance of affordability for houses with some land, and weather. There are perhaps better deals on the Hamakua coast north of Hilo, but it's really, really wet there.

## Meeting People

Hawai'i is filled with friendly, wonderful people. At the same time, it can be very difficult to make deep connections with the people you meet. Why? One of the biggest reasons is that many newcomers to Hawai'i don't stay for very long. It can get tiring to make friends with someone only to have them leave a couple months later. The reasons people leave vary, but are ususally related to (not) being able to earn a decent living. So, long-term residents can be a bit wary of making new friendships. We've found that it's very easy to make basic connections with people, but it takes time to earn their trust. One of the biggest things you can do to build that is to get involved. Volunteer and be *present* in your community and people will connect with you.

## Lessons Learned

We've been here for a year now. Overall, we're super happy with the location we picked to live and I've worked out a good remote work rhythm. Our biggest challenge right now is the constant struggle to adapt from a "mainland attitude" to "island life". Some of the points worth considering before making the leap to working remotely from Hawai'i include:

- Come visit before deciding to move. Probably more than once. What island you pick will largely depend on what calls to you -- urban, rural, somewhere in between...
- Check (and double check) internet access availability in your desired area
- Leave the mainland attitude at the airport when you land
- Pick a work schedule that fits your lifestyle. Do you like to get up early? If so, you can most likely get a full day in with lots of overlap with mainland colleagues AND still have time to go surfing in the afternoon.
- Plan for higher prices (especially food) and adapt your lifestyle before coming. Do you like tropical fruit, grass-fed beef, and fresh veggies? You can have a reasonable food budget eating local fresh food.
- Progress is slower here. People don't always show up to appointments or return calls. Don't get discouraged -- there are plenty of reliable tradespeople here, you just need to do some research.
- Making friends is going to be harder. So many people move to Hawai'i and then leave after a year or two that it can be tiring for long-term residents to make connections that are likely to be unstable. You can make this better by diving into the local community. Volunteer, go to the market, and TALK to people.
