We have a flock of twenty-five chickens (including 3 roosters) of mixed ages. We inherited some from the previous owner of our property and the rest have arrived as surprise babies and feral captures. Before we moved to Hawai'i I had wanted to raise chickens, but there was never an opportunity due to HOA restrictions. Going from zero to twenty-five has been a bit of a learning curve, to say the least!

Everyone knows roosters are noisy, right? They are, but I think hens are actually a lot noisier overall. Roosters have a very loud crow, which they like to use at (often) inopportune times. If you have more than one, they'll get each other going and it can go on for several minutes of back-and-forth crowing. Definitely unpleasant if they're doing it when you are trying to sleep. It's also generally not a constant thing. Each rooster is different, but you start to see patterns in their morning and nighttime crowing.

Hens have [20+ distinct sounds][1] and they like to use them for hours at a time. Every. Single. Day. As an example, we have a few hens that love to fly out of the run to find some secluded spot to lay an egg (or not, but that's a topic for another day). Every morning, those chickens will find that spot, do their laying business, and then emerge making a constant, repetitive noise seemingly for the simple joy of sharing that they've laid an egg. There is some thought that the noise is meant to help them locate the rest of the flock so they can rejoin it, which seems plausible when you notice the rest of the flock responding to the egg call. Again, and again, even when the chicken is literally in sight of the flock it will continue celebrating its egg.

To be fair, the egg "song" makes some sense. It serves a purpose. Then there's the "Buck-buck-buck-beegaw" noise. It seems to be purpose built to annoy. They do it when they're wandering around. They do it when they're standing on top of the rain shelter in the coop. They do it when they are stuck under the house. They do it pretty much whenever they feel like it, and most of the time it triggers at least a couple other birds to join in. Back-and-forth for twenty minutes sometimes. It's maddening when it's happening right outside your window. Yelling at the chickens, I've discovered, is useful for letting out some frustration, but does very little to make them shut up!

As I was writing this post I realized there was another noise which is so constant I've mostly tuned it out. It goes something like "baarww, baarww, baarw". Over and over again. It's not super load -- it's more of a background noise. While it's good that I've been able to mostly tune it out, it's not exactly exciting that there is a constant low-level chatter. 

Based on what I've said so far it might make it seem like I'm unhappy with having chickens. I'm not. They're pretty fun to watch -- we call it "Chicken TV". They give us eggs (sometimes even in the nest boxes!). The extra roosters "give" (they might disagree) us meat. They poop and it feeds our garden. Really, they are pretty useful animals, but they are not quiet and anyone who tells you that roosters are the major noise problem has not lived with more than a couple of hens. So, don't (solely) blame the rooster if your neighbors aren't happy with your chicken noise!
