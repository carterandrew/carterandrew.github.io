I'm a software engineer by training, having worked in a number of engineering roles since graduating from Cornell University in 2004. Over the last fifteen years my focus has evolved towards building tooling and infrastructure to improve the velocity and happiness of other engineers. My most recent roles (including at Google) have focused on that specifically.

In 2018 I left Google in Boulder, CO where I had worked for four years, and moved to the Big Island of Hawai'i with my family. The main motivation for the move was to be able to grow delicious food year-round, and ultimately to be able to grow enough for our family to be self-sufficient. I'm slowly working towards that goal, and I'm planning to share parts of that journey on this site.
